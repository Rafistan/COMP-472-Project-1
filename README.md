## How to run the project

Each step has its own python file (ie. `step_1.py`, `step_2.py`, `step_3.py`). Step 2 also has an extra python file for number 2.5, called `step2_5.py`.
For running the different models for problem 3.8, simply uncomment whichever model you would like to use from lines 14-16 and run the project there. It should create all of the output files alongside the graphs.
